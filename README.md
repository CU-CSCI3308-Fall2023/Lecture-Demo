# Lecture-Activity

We will use this repository to practice basic git commands and learn about branches.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Explore the configuration of the git repository.
3. Create a branch with your name. See the changes in the config file.
4. Edit practice.cpp and implement any 1 function of your choice and make a call to it in the main() function.
5. Check the status of your files.
6. Stage and commit the changes.
7. Push the changes to your branch.
8. CHeck on GitHub if you can see the changes.
9. I will show a demo of merging branches and how to create a pull request. You will be doing this step in the lab.
